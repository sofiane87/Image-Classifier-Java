# Image-Classifier-Java

This repository presents a code that aimed to add a new Image classifier, using Random Forests to **Levis** an *Image classification software* coded by *Mines Paristech*'s Robotics lab : *CAOR*

The package is composed of two sub_modules : 
* hog : Histogram of Oriented Gradients
* randomForests : Random Forest Calssifier 

## hog :

This sub-module handles the images **preprocessing**, it takes images as inputs and returns the associated **Histogram of Oriented Gradients**
